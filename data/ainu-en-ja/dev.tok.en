My mother said that it was the place called Cenpak . We lived .
We lived in a place the sea , but
Weeping , my mother would go to the mountains .
When she went to the mountains , she would carry meat covered in mud and fish covered in mud on her back .
She would carry it back , and while eating this
she would feed me the better pieces , and when I grew up ,
my mother said ,
&quot; Your uncle lives in Osorkot .
You also have an uncle in Kuttarusi .
They each have one daughter , and
when you grow up , if you become husband and wife with those girls ,
people having the ancestors will be gathered .
Your father said so before he left this world .
You must listen to this and remember it in your heart , &quot;
my mother kept telling me like this
I grew up and learned to catch many deer and bears .
While I never thought about what I wanted to eat or have ,
the girl who was in Osorkot went to the mountains ,
you could not tell where her face was ,
or where her body was ,
She came back so hairy
and she spent her life crying , but
even her parents could not say anything .
What if that girl was to disappear
whether it &apos;s a bad Kamui or whatever , it is here to take care of us &quot;
said the fathers .
The villagers were spooked and frightened .
I heard that it was said that they passed on the mountain side of the village
As I was listening to this ,
my mother said ,
&quot; Son , you must never think about or go to a place where there is such talk , &quot;
is all Father ... Mother kept saying to me as we lived our lives , but
I thought I would go and see sometime .
To tell the truth , that is what I was thinking so ,
I acted like I was getting ready to go to the mountains ,
When I came back from the mountains ,
When I returned to my home ,
I left in the mountains the things I was going to carry .
That was so I could carry up good things .
I left a little bit up at a time ,
and soon there were many things I had taken to the mountain .
Because I said I was going to the mountains ,
my mother prepared polished grains and various dried foods .
Because I said I was traveling lightly to the mountains , she prepared these things .
I carried these with the food I had left in the mountain .
I carried my large bundle of luggage and headed for Osorkot . Then ,
even though she looked peculiar , it was said that she was a hard worker .
She was tidying up around her house .
It appeared that there was not a single piece of trash outside her house , but
at the head of the house
it did not look like a catch had been sent off from the altar for a long time ,
I thought they were having a deprived life .
When I coughed to announce my arrival ,
an extremely beautiful woman came out .
Shading her eyes with her hands , she looked at me from bottom to top , and
then she turned around and entered the house .
&quot; Someone who must be your nephew from Cenpak ,
a grand young man is standing outside &quot;
she said ... I could hear a voice .
I could hear the voice of the house &apos;s elder .
No matter what kind of life we are living ,
why don &apos;t you invite in people who came to enter our house ? &quot;
I could hear someone say .
laid down a grass mat , and swept away the dirt ,
She came outside and sat down properly , and invited me inside . She showed great respect to me .
With my belongings still on my back , I entered and
I placed my belongings at my uncle &apos;s place of honor .
My uncle who was sitting near the hearth politely greeted me and said ,
&quot; Where did you come from young man ? &quot;
he asked .
&quot; For this and this reason , I walked from Cenpak &quot;
I said .
&quot; We had been longing for our nephew to come , but before he could arrive ,
our daughter , a beautiful young woman should we say it ourselves ,
went to the mountains to gather firewood , and came back covered in hair .
She came back in a form that we can &apos;t even tell where her face is .
We have been grieving this daily .
Our daughter has been crying while taking care of us , but
we are afraid that if we say something she will go away ,
and we will not be able to fend for ourselves , so
we have passing time while not able to say anything . &quot;
my uncle said .
So I responded ,
&quot; No matter what your daughther looks like , I have come to take her as my wife &quot;
I said .
My uncle was very
&quot; Our nephew has come to take our daughter who has transformed
and will take her to kill her &quot;
&quot; Why should I kill her ? If that &apos;s what you think
I will return her to her original self
and bring her back for uncle to see .
I will show her to you . &quot;
I said .
My uncle remained speechless .
When he opened my bags and looked ,
&quot; .
When the gods I worship were young ,
those who cooked delicious food and ate delicious food
were the beasts of the mountains , but
I have grown weak because of my age , and even though I am leading a meager life ,
if my daughter was still her beautiful self ,
if my nephew came with those belongings on his back , then it is fine , but
my daughter , for some reason , now looks like this ,
I was so embarrassed , but
here my nephew has really brought these gifts
on his back . &quot;
he said as he continued worshipping .
He cut and placed some in the flames and gave it to the Fire , and so on .
gave the meat to the Kamui here and there and prayed .
His wife came , and while rubbing my knees ,
she rubbed under her nose to show her gratitude for the food .
They were thankful for the food I had carried up . Then ,
then , there was a noise outside .
It sounded like a bundle of firewood being thrown .
The wife went outside and then came back in .
You really could not tell where her face was .
It was covered in hair , but had the appearance of a woman .
Even though she looked like this , she cautiously entered and sat down properly .
She sat near the left upwind seat .
When I greeted her , she rubbed under her nose and continued to greet me . Then ,
the elder of the house said this .
&quot; This brother of yours from Cenpak , came here alone to find you .
He brought us gifts . He didn &apos;t bring gifts just for the Kamui .
It &apos;s not only humans who give gifts , so
you must prepare something delicious
and I have already asked the Kamui who we worship , so
even if nephew takes you ,
the guardian god will protect you , &quot;
the elder said .
dropped large tears
and wiped her face .
&quot; Go prepare dinner &quot; , said .
Looking from behind ,
I could see that had gone to the corner and was crying .
When she faced forward , she wiped her tears .
Her hands looked terrible , but she washed them well ,
washed her face well , and then wiped her face .
She also wiped her hands .
She washed the pot clean , and placed it on the fire .
She cut the food I had carried up and filled the pot .
She soaked in water mountain vegetables . She soaked the mountain vegetables in water , then cooked them and served .
She served her father .
She the good parts , and avoided putting the untasty pieces of meat from the end .
She served the good parts to her father .
She did the same for me and her mother .
And she served herself the pieces from the end .
I felt very sorry for her .
&quot; Did she do something bad and then became like this ? &quot;
I wondered , but I did not try to sleep near her ,
or to give her half of my full bowl of food .
I do not know why .
It seemed that if I did something , something bad would happen , so I did not do it .
Morning came , so
&quot; Hurry , and go gather firewood .
After I have butchered the catch ,
I will help you carry it .
If you come with me , you won &apos;t be able to return for a long time , so
I will go to the mountains to get food for uncle and everyone to eat .
I will catch many deer and bears and leave them for uncles .
So let &apos;s go to my house . &quot;
I said . She seemed very happy as she went to gather firewood .
On the other hand , my uncle taught me about his hunting gear
and lowered the gear I found on the shelf .
I took these to the mountains
and caught a young bear , so I carried the whole bear back home
and placed it at the altar before entering the house .
I told my uncle .
he fixed his sash , and went outside .
He worshipped over and over , and then
he butchered the bear with his own hands and brought the meat inside .
Anything I could carry on my back , even deer ,
I carried the whole pieces on my back and gave to my uncle .
I placed them at the altar and he butchered them .
I caught many deer and bears .
Enough food to pass the year even during the winter ,
that ’ show much food I gathered .
It was autumn so I also caught fish .
The girl worked hard to gather firewood , but
I helped by carrying it on my back to the shed .
The girl went to draw water by herself .
There was enough to drink , so
&quot; Drink , draw and use the water yourselves .
You must not eat meager meals , fix proper food and eat it .
Somehow I will turn my sister into a human , and when she &apos;s ready to come I will bring her down , so
Uncle , please do not worry about us , and wait here . &quot;
I said .
I had brought refined grains so Uncle &apos;s family made a little bit of porridge with it .
After they drank the soup ,
we ate after them , but shortly
&quot; Well , I am going home .
My mother will be worried about me , &quot;
I said. food to eat during the winter ,
and wood to put in the fire .
When I was about to leave ,
what a wonderful the girl was .
The wife brought out a bag with wonderful garments
and filled the bag full .
She also packed necklaces brought down from her grandmother .
Then , the wife brought out a small box ,
&quot; If you face any trouble , open this box , &quot;
She said , as I watched her give it .
I thought it was some sort of amulet .
I took the girl and went home .
Because her belongings were heavy , I carried them at times .
And at times , I had her carry the luggage . And finally we came .
When we reached my home and went inside
&quot; My son said he was going to the mountains ,
I wonder why he came home empty-handed ? &quot;
my mother said , but
I quietly sat down .
She thought for a moment , and I had gone to Kuttarusi ,
and brought back my sister from Kuttarusi . Appearing to be relieved , she went outside .
She went out front and screamed .
&quot; My stupid son , look what you have brought back !
What in the world did you bring back ? &quot;
she said
and started shouting at my sister .
She swore at me as well ,
but I stayed quiet and I called the girl into the house .
Even though her appearance was bad , she was a hard worker .
She never poked at the embers .
She worked hard at gathering firewood , cooking and drawing water , but still
my stupid mother kept shouting at us . But secretly ,
&quot; Stay quiet no matter what she says , &quot;
I said , and went to the mountains to catch many deer and bears .
In time , almost as I never thought I ’ d say it myself ,
&quot; Go cut some grass for a house .
I will build a new house with that &quot;
I said . When I went and came back from the mountains ,
enough grass to really build a big house
had been piled up .
Since I had said it myself , I built a house . There ,
If I make live with my mother forever , I will feel unhappy , so
I had my sister live in that house . Then ,
one time , I killed a deer .
I killed a big deer , and carried it home ,
I placed it on the side altar ,
&quot; If you eat all of this deer tonight , I will make you my wife , &quot;
I said and came home .
After I returned to my own home and finished dinner ,
I felt like going outside so I went out of my home .
Bright lights were on , so
I went over to have a look .
She was crying , but after a while she stood up
and took the small box from the bottom of the bag .
When she opened the cover , a never-ending flock of crows flew out from the box .
They gathered over the deer ,
and ate the deer in a flash . Then ,
they all returned into the box , and I watched carefully away .
I went back to my home , but
the next evening , I got worried and went outside .
Bright lights were on .
The lights were on so I went over to have a look through the window .
Wearing the robes of a dead person , the robes of the dead ,
wearing a beautifully sewn robe of the dead
she took out a razor from the bottom of her bag ,
and just as she was about to cut her own throat , I entered .
I jumped in
&quot; What do you think you are doing ? &quot;
I said as I grabbed her hand .
I heard something tear , something explode over me .
From then on , whether I was asleep or dead .
My heart felt like it was twisted and turned , and when I returned to consciousness ,
as to the girl , everything that had been covering her body had fallen to under her buttocks
and she appeared to be completely dead in my arms .
That &apos;s when my mother came .
She had heard a noise and came over .
She raised her voice , shouting of the emergency .
, I opened my eyes and sat up .
I knew that this was the fault of the God of Lightning , a Kamui , so
I said this to the God of Lightning .
&quot; Great Kamui , Kamui only marry regular humans ,
Humans only marry regular humans .
It is true that we are both adults , but
Kamui should only marry Kamui , so
why did such a great Kamui transform the woman who was to be my wife ?
It is unforgivable under any circumstances .
If you are not going to return her soul to me ,
I will kick you with your father and brothers to the neverworld underground .
Don &apos;t forget it ! &quot;
I said as I prayed to the Kamui , and in time
it became night , and little by little , her heart began to pulsate .
I was able to bring her back to life .
When I saw that what covered her had fallen off ,
even though she was a dead person ,
she was so beautiful I could not express it with words .
She dead , but the light from her face shone throughout the house .
As I cared for her , she came back to life .
She continued to cry , but I was tired , so
soon and saw a dream .
,
a young man who looked like a Kamui said angrily ,
&quot; Young man from Cenpak , listen carefully to what I have to say .
I am one of the two Lightning God brothers ,
the younger brother .
I did not find anyone I liked among the Kamui ,
and when I looked around the human world , I fell for this one girl .
I thought you would be frightened by what I did , so
I changed her appearance , but
you brought her home without being afraid .
Moreover , she had an amulet from her mother , because the Kamui punished me
Even the grass to build a house ,
usually just a human , just a woman cannot cut enough grass for a house in one day , though ,
she did cut the grass for the house .
You built a house and you lived separately , so
I thought I would kill her there .
I made you think many things ,
I made you carry home the deer , and if she did not eat it within one night
I made you tell her that you would kill her and not make her your wife , but
she had that amulet , and was protected from the Kamui so
I lost because of the power of the amulet .
One night passed , but
One night passed , but
you are with your mother
I wanted to kill and take her soul , but
no matter what I do , the Kamui interrupts me , and I have lost , but
I did not have enough power for .
I will snatch her in the middle of her life and make her my wife in the Kamui world .
You had better remember that , &quot;
I dreamed .
I woke up ,
&quot; Kamui should marry Kamui and humans should marry humans , so
if you love the woman ,
we would make sake from the woman has grown ,
and we would worship you with the sake and prayer sticks , then
you could be a greater Kamui with them , but
you even said that you were going to abduct a young person in the middle of her life .
If you are going to keep on doing these things ,
I will kick you and your father and brothers to the neverworld . Don &apos;t forget ! &quot;
saying this , I kept praying to the Kamui , but
I was also mad at my mother , so
instead of going back to my mother ’ s ,
I went straight to live together with my wife .
Since I felt pity for her ,
I was careful not to say anything to make fun of her .
She cooked for me ,
and she went and gathered firewood .
Once , I took some game I had caught to my mother &apos;s place ,
and sometimes I took my catch to my own home , but
mother never came .
And I did not go to my mothers ’ home .
One day my mother came
and the girl from Kuttarusi
became angry at what ensued .
There was a poor youngster at the outskirts of the village ,
she was with that man , but
that poor youngster became very good at hunting , and was well protected by the Kamui ,
these were such rumours that were going around , so
I wanted to go and see .
I gathered some worn clothes and put them on . I painted charcoal onto my body , and painted snot over me as well .
I looked very intimidating ,
and went to Cenpak .
The rumors said they lived on the outskirts of the village , so
I went and looked like a poor man outside the house and looked around .
There , my sister , a very beautiful woman just as they said ,
came outside and looked at me .
&quot; You mean man , you headed straight toward the beautiful woman , but
why did you come here dressed like that ? You look indecent . &quot;
She abused me and went into her house .
I followed her inside ,
and with the eyes of a poor man , I looked all around the house from above a shelf
&quot; No matter what you do , you are dressed shamefully ,
why are you looking around so much ? &quot;
she said
continuing to abuse me , but she still made me a delicious meal
and while feeding me
&quot; Now , now , before my husband comes home you must leave because you are a shame &quot;
she said to me , but
I wanted to trick her somehow , so
&quot; Sister , what is your amulet ?
You have such a nice life , won &apos;t you show me what is ?
When I said this , she yelled at me .
&quot; No matter what you say , you bad brother
are dressed in such an indecent manner , and you are speaking to me like that ? &quot;
she said , but in the end
&quot; Mother , ‘ When you go to the river and wash your face ... go outside and clean ...
clean around the fire , and clean inside the house , then
when you go to the river to wash your face , you will find something special . &quot;
my mother always said , but
one day when I went to the river to wash my face , I looked upstream , and
something shiny was floating down and coming closer toward me on the bank , so
I had a look .
On a silver tray was a small silver knife still in its sheath .
Shining brightly it floated down the river toward me , so I took it and kept it as my amulet .
I was going to use it as your amulet if I lived with you , but
I heard that you were living with my relative , so
I kept it as a poor youngster &apos;s protection , and became wealthy &quot; ,
she said , so
&quot; If you would just show it to me , I &apos;ll take a look and then leave &quot;
I said .
She took down a box and untied the string . Hesitating , she took it out
untied the box &apos;s string , and brought it to me .
&quot; Here , my husband used this as his amulet and became so wealthy .
We are able to live comfortably , &quot; she .
&quot; I can &apos;t see it very well from there . Please bring it close so I can have a look , &quot;
I said and she brought it close .
A small silver fish was engraved around one side of the small knife &apos;s sheath .
A small gold fish was engraved around the other side of the sheath .
The house seemed to light up with its shine .
She put the small knife in the sheath , and
brought it near me .
&quot; If you would come just a little closer I could see it so well , &quot;
I kept saying , and she brought it near me .
I grabbed the knife from her hands and jumped outside .
I brought the knife to my house , and
put it in the bottom of a box .
According to rumors I heard after that
all of their fortune disappeared as if it was flying away ,
and they were fighting . They kept fighting while the food was on the fire ,
and no matter what she made or what she cooked , it all flew away I heard .
One night mother came
and told me to come with her , so I went .
That girl was there , and she cursed at me .
&quot; You bad brother . I yelled at you because you were dressed so poorly , but
if you hadn &apos;t tricked me and left like that
I would have chased after you instead of yelling , but
our fortune has flown away .
You , my bad brother , ran off with my amulet .
You , my brother , who was like a grand Kamui , tricked me like that &quot;
she said and told me off .
I didn &apos;t have anything to say , so I stayed quiet .
I went back to my own home , but because she yelled at me like that
it angered me to leave my legal wife with my mother , so
I made that sister from Kuttarusi live with my mother .
I kept my wife from Osorkot as my first wife , and
I went and caught many deer and bears .
I finally got around to visiting my uncle &apos;s family in Osorkot .
Since we did not have children , and since I wanted to take , I took her with me ,
When we got there , my uncles cried and worshipped me .
Then I went to the mountain and caught deer and bears ...
They still had food and firewood , but
my wife gathered firewood , and I went to the mountains and caught many deer and bears .
We made preserves but , should we ever had children
we thought we would not be able to walk around here and there , so
elegant girls , or healthy youngsters or girls ,
tell me and we will make them marry and have them live next to uncles .
I &apos;m worried about leaving by themselves , &quot;
I said .
My wife named some healthy youngsters and girls ,
and I married them .
We had them live next to the older folks .
Uncles were so happy so
we had them live next door .
&quot; I have no intention of taking uncles ’ assets , so
youngsters , stay near uncle ,
and care for them so that they live comfortably , &quot;
I said and left .
Next , I took my sister to uncle &apos;s place in Kuttarusi .
It was my first time to meet uncle , so
uncle worshipped me , and repeated words of thanks .
I went to the mountains . I wanted to prepare delicious foods for uncle , so I went to the moutains
and caught many deer and bears .
still young so
they gathered firewood by themselves and placed them on the fire , they said , so
I told my wife to gather firewood .
She also gathered a lot of wood .
Here in Kuttarusi as well , we hired a fine young woman ... husband and wife ,
and had them live next to uncles .
We came home , and as we led our lives ,
the bellies of my wives started to grow , and when they bore children
they both had baby boys .
Mother did not even look at my first wife &apos;s child .
Since she lived with the wife I brought from Kuttarusi ,
ｍother cherished her child , but she did not love my child .
&quot; It &apos;s better not to say anything to mother , &quot;
I said to my wife as we led our lives , and in time we had many children .
We had to show our children to uncles , so
we prepared a large bundle to take .
Though the youngsters I hired also caught many game , they truly did ,
we packed a large amount of the fine fatty pieces .
My wife carried a child on her back , and we went down to uncle &apos;s place .
Uncle was thrilled .
Aunt were also thrilled so
we stayed over for many days .
I went to the mountains with the youngsters , and caught many deer and bears .
When we came back , when we came back home ,
next we went to show our children to my wife &apos;s uncles in Kuttarusi ...
When we went to show the grandchildren
My uncle from Kuttarusi was also very happy .
He was thrilled to see his grandchildren .
In time ,
the youngsters we had hired at each place were also blessed with children .
They loved our children .
The wives were surrounded by children , so
when I went to visit by myself ,
&quot; With nephew &apos;s help ,
we wanted children so much , and we are satisfied .
They said .
My wives made clothes for the uncles , even their burial outfits .
They made many things while they were alive
and I carried these and presented them to uncles . In time ,
my children also grew up , so
&quot; I will have the youngster from Osorkot have my son as their younger brother , &quot;
I said and took him .
I felt sorry for uncle , so I had live next door .
I immediately built a separate house for the youngsters I had hired ,
and had them live there .
&quot; I have many valuable dishes , but
since I do not have any brothers , &quot;
I said and gave many of uncle &apos;s treasures to the youngsters I had hired .
I had uncle &apos;s own grandson live near uncle , and when he grew up
he became husband and wife with a beautiful woman . They took care of grandfather .
Even those youngsters I had hired
treated me as their uncle . They took very good care of my old man .
The same happened in Kuttarusi .
I never thought about what I wanted to eat or have .
Each of my wives had an amulet , so
our lives were enriched by that .
Becoming an elder matched by no one else ,
I also let my mother spend a wonderful old age .
Uncles as well . When I went to visit , they died as though they had been waiting for me .
Uncles in Kuttarusi and Osorkot died , and
after I took good care of all my mothers-in-law ,
since there was our son , while I could walk ,
I went back and forth between our son &apos;s place , Kuttarusi and Osorkot .
In time I couldn &apos;t even walk anymore .
The sons and grandchildren went back and forth . As we led our lives discussing things ,
I was also aging , so
for this and this reason , to the God of Lightning ,
we gave sake and prayer sticks to the God of Lightning , and
I think we were the protected ones .
Nothing was frightening ,
and even my
but we lived together until we were old .
But I am now old ,
and my sons have seen and know that I am living like this , so
&quot; We pray to God of Lightning , Grandfather of Lightning , &quot;
, and if you have sake ,
send prayer sticks or sake to the God of Lightning .
When you put prayer sticks up , the will be your guardian god .
The God of Lightning travels the world and
is very scary because he does many things , but
if you pray , you will have nothing to be frightened of &quot;
I said and died ,
said the real rich man .
I had an older sister and two older brothers and so we lived .
I thought my older sister was the finest woman of all .
My older brothers listened to whatever she said , and did various things as we led our lives .
Older sister ... older sister ...
When older brothers grew up , they went and caught many deer and bears .
I lived without wanting food or things .
a very large house which seemed to belong to a very rich man .
Such things as valuable dishes were stacked in two rows .
As we lived our lives in this way , one day
older sister said this ,
&quot; Younger brothers . If we go to the mouth of our Iskar River ,
and catch fish which has just come from the ocean , they will be fatty and very delicious .
Go to the beach and catch some fish . &quot;
Hearing this , older brothers gladly went down to the beach .
Later , older sister put a large pot on the fire .
Under it ... there she fetched water ... she carried water .
She put a pot which had three handles onto the fire , and filled it with water .
She pounded and cut fish and meat into small pieces
and filled the pot with them .
She poked the firewood underneath .
&quot; Why is she cooking so much food ? &quot;
I wondered , but ,
since she could not lower the large pot ,
she put half of the food into another pot , and set it onto the east side of the hearth .
She washed some bowls and placed them on the east side of the hearth .
&quot; The old man of the mountain , &quot;
The old man of the mountain is in the firewood hut , so
go outside and tell him to come in and eat dinner , &quot; older sister said .
Why do I have to tell the old man of the mountain that ? I didn &apos;t go out because I was scared .
Older sister went out . &quot; Old man of the mountain , come inside and eat dinner , &quot;
she said and went back into the house .
I was scared so I sat to the right seat of honor .
A man , almost as big as two men combined , three men combined ,
very large man wearing red robes ,
with a red beard , a long beard reaching his chest . This large man came in ,
and without greeting older sister ,
went directly to the seat of honor .
&quot; There is no one to serve the old man of the mountain , so serve yourself and eat , &quot;
older sister said .
He served himself , and eat and eat he did . He emptied the large pot .
He even drank all of the soup , and then went outside . Then ,
older sister prepared food . We ate and spent the night .
In the morning , older sister prepared food again and we ate .
&quot; Let &apos;s go down the mountain after your brothers who went to the beach , &quot;
older sister said as she put me in the boat . She securely closed the house &apos;s door , and we went down the mountain .
When we reached the beach , older brothers had lifted many fish onto the shore .
They filleted the fish ... They were getting ready to lift many fish onto the shore .
Older sister went down and started to gather firewood . I helped older sister .
I was told to gather firewood , so I picked up driftwood .
Older sister made a shelf , filleted the fish , and cooked it .
When roasted she took them up on the shelf , and again filleted the fish .
She did so but older brothers raised the fish . Older sister laid out many fish to dry .
She made dried fish . We spent the night and the next morning ,
&quot; Younger brothers , you must go home tomorrow , &quot;
older sister said .
She put the fish into the boat , and stood on the bow of the boat .
I was amazed at how well older sister could handle the boat .
She rowed the boat with a long stick .
A large Japanese judas tree was uprooted on the banks .
We passed under its boughs which were stretched out .
The trunk was submerged in the river , so we went under it .
Under the tree , under the tree bank stretched out like poles ,
older sister lifted the boat and fixed it with a painter .
She went up the bank , and she did not come back .
I waited but older sister didn &apos;t come down , so
I went up the banks . A large poplar tree had fallen over . The tree which guarded over the large village had fallen over , the large ...
A tree had fallen over , and behind it
I saw my older sister gobbling a large snake .
Then something weird ran out from the shadows of the tree .
Kicking small stones and breaking trees , it appeared to run along the river up the mountain .
I shivered seeing this .
&quot; Isn &apos;t older sister a normal human that I am living with ? &quot;
I thought . I went down the banks and went to the boat .
Later , older sister also came down , got into the boat , and we went home .
We moored the boat at our pier , and carried the fish home from there .
We tied the fish and hung them from the ceiling ,
hung them on the house walls and hung them from the shelf over the hearth .
We prepared dinner and spent the night .
The next morning , older brothers brought home a boatful of fish .
Some were dried out , and some hadn &apos;t even been prepared yet .
Older sister filleted these at home , cooked them and dried them .
When we ate at night , older sister said ,
&quot; Younger brothers , listen well .
I was clairvoyant ever since I was small .
When the plague came to our village and wiped it out , father said to me ,
‘ Daughter , you are the descendant of a Kamui ,
that &apos;s why you are clairvoyant ,
you must protect your younger brothers and sisters and raise them . You must make sure that the smoke from the house does not stop even after . &quot;
Father said this to me and left this world .
Just as he said , we four lived and have continued our lives .
However , I saw that the old man of the mountain fell in love with me , and is coming down the mountain .
It &apos;s not safe for you to stay here .
To the beach . We had just caught fish at the pier , and had enough fish , but
if I sent you to the beach ,
and fed him after you left , everything would be fine .
That &apos;s why I made food in the pot with three ears , and fed him .
He ate so much I was surprised . Little sister was also surprised .
When we went down to the beach ,
he appeared in front of me again , so I raised the boat to the shore .
There &apos;s no one more scared of snakes than bears , so
I made it look like I was swallowing a snake .
I didn &apos;t really swallow it .
I am a Kamui , and I made it look like that . That &apos;s what he saw it , so
‘ Was I about to make such a woman my wife ? &quot;
so thinking , the bear who had been hiding in the shadows of the fallen tree ,
ran away . Little sister heard the sound and was scared by my deed .
I didn &apos;t eat .
Since I showed him this , little sister was scared of me when we came home .
Nothing frightening should happen after this .
That bear is afraid of me as well , so he shouldn &apos;t think that way anymore .
From now on , I will use my power to get people to travel here .
I &apos;m sure I will get married , and you also will marry humans .
Some people will come fleeing from famine , and some will come fleeing from war .
Some will sister , some will be husband and wife .
Some may bring their daughters here alone . These people will travel , so I &apos;m sure you will marry .
You must listen carefully to what I say , &quot; .
Older brothers were very surprised ,
&quot; It was because of you older sister , &quot; they said surprised . Some time passed .
One day we heard a sound outside .
When older sister went out , a very fine man ,
a man carrying a quiver entered , and started living with us .
Without ever leaving , he became husband and wife with older sister , and together they lived .
After a while , some women came from somewhere and stayed at our house .
Older sister welcomed them , giving them meals and treasures . Thus my oldest brother also married .
My younger older brother also married , and to the left of house ...
I built my older brother &apos;s house to the right of house ,
and my younger younger brother &apos;s house . Then they got married and lived there .
During that time , people who were fleeing from famine , and people who were fleeing from war passed by .
Couples and young people , even people with their daughters .
Many different passed .
Those who had many valuable dishes and food
were my older sister and brothers , so by .
Our village had been a run down place , but
I also grew up and married a fine young man who came from somewhere .
After I built a separate house and started to live here
older brothers were blessed with children . Older sister also had a child .
All the villagers were young so
everyone had children and our village became very cheerful .
I also had a child .
Older sister had a child first , so
older sister &apos;s child became a rich man with no equals .
Older sister &apos;s child and older brother &apos;s children all became .
Older sister &apos;s son married first .
Older sister saw his child born , but
she was old . Before those sons were very old ,
before the girls had married ,
she only saw the older son get married before she left this world . She left saying ,
&quot; You are the very youngest , so you must watch over your nephews ’ lives , &quot;
she said to me as she left this world .
Older brothers were great hunters with no equals .
Their daughters and their sons married .
They had children , and older brothers lived long enough to eat food their grandchildren had prepared .
My first older brother left this world first , and then my younger older brother died .
All the villagers were newcomers , so they married each other and made a large bustling village .
Without wanting food or things ,
my children also grew and each married .
After my first older brother .. and my younger older brother left this world ,
I was the very youngest so
I was to live a long life , but
I watched over the lives of my nieces and grandchildren , and then I left this world .
&quot; Let &apos;s live in the afterworld together , &quot;
older brothers had said to me when they died , so
I lived a long life in the human world .
I watched over the lives of my grandchildren , my sons and nephews .
The tribe was rich and no one fought each other .
The tribe tried their best to make me like them , and they liked me .
As we led our lives without fighting over anything , not even food
I have grown so old . That is why I am telling my sons this ,
a fine woman said .
